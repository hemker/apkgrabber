# APKGetter
APKGetter is a fork of [APKGrabber](https://github.com/hemker/apkgrabber) which is a fork of [APKUpdater](https://github.com/rumboalla/apkupdater). Big thanks and of course
credits go to [hemker](https://github.com/hemker) and also to the original producer [rumboalla](https://github.com/rumboalla).
I try to develop new features and maintain the software to stay available on latest android devices,
but don't expect weekly updates.

# Roadmap
* [?] Implementing more sources.
  - ?
* [ ] Fixing Google Play sign-in system
* [ ] Adding getting update descriptions from APK Mirror
* [ ] Suggesting to user which APKs are combatable with their running device
* [ ] Updating the build system, as it's full of deprecation warnings.
